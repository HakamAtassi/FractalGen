## The Mandelbrot Set
The Mandelbrot set is the set of (imaginary) numbers whose magnitudes do not exceed some arbitrary bound when recursively squared and added to themselves. 
This relationship can be represented as $z$=$z^2$+$c$, where $c$ is the inital coordinate. In this case, the maximum bound of |$z$| is 2, and the number of iterations per number is 1000. 


## Algorithms
The construction of the Mandelbrot fractal involves 2 main algorithms: the first to determine the pixels that fall within the Mandelbrot set, and the second to apply coloring to the pixels that do not fall within the set. 

  
  
### Mapping
The mapping process determines wether the pixel at some specified x,y coordinate falls within the Mandelbrot set. This task is quite simple and is demonstrated in the following pseudo-code:


```
for x in width of image  
  for y in height of image  
    count=0
    z=imaginary(x,y)  
    c=z
    while count<1000 and |z|<2  
      z=z*z+c
      count++
```
If count, the number of times the formula $z$=$z^2$+$c$ is applied, is 1000, the number is considered stable and within the Mandelbrot set. If count is under 1000, then the number exceeded the abitrary bound of 2 and is not considered to be part of the Mandelbrot set.  
The result of count for each pixel is stored in an array named fractal. The number of pixels for each possible count is stored in an array named histogram. This data is crutial to the coloring of the fractal.

### Coloring
Prior to applying color and generating the fractal, a few intermediary steps take place. The first of which splits all possible pixels into a bins of iterations (count). For instance, 300k pixels exceeded a magnitude of 2 between 0-100 iterations, 80k pixels exceeded a magnitude of 2 between 100-300 iterations, and so forth...  
Next, the program calculates a ratio of the number of pixels for that specific number of iterations to the total number of pixels in that range. This ratio determines how quickly colors transition in the fractal.  
To determine the actual color of a pixel, an arbitrary color is assigned to the start of each range. As the program iterates over every pixel in the fractal, its color is determined by adding its starting color to the ratio multiplied by the change in colors (final color - starting color). The formula looks something like 
```
colorDiff=startColor-endColor;

//totalPixels=number of pixels with n iterations. 
//rangeTotal= number of pixels with [a,b] iterations

red=startColor.red+colorDiff.red*totalPixels/rangeTotal;    
green=startColor.green+colorDiff.green*totalPixes/rangeTotal;
blue=startColor.blue+colorDiff.blue*totalPixes/rangeTotal;

bitmap.setPixel(x,y,red,green,blue);    //set pixel color
```
If the ratio of totalPixels to rangeTotal is 0, there will be no color transition for that range. If the ratio is very high, the color transition will be very sharp.
